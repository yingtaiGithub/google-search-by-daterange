U.S. stocks capped the best week since January, with the S&P 500 Index climbing above 2,500 for the first time, as investors showed resilience in the face of a North Korean missile test. The dollar weakened after an unexpected decline in August retail sales raised concern over the economy’s strength.Investors largely shrugged off the latest rise in tensions on the Korean peninsula and a terrorist attack in London, with haven assets from the yen to gold declining. The S&P 500 took the round-number milestone in the final minutes of trading to end the week with a 1.6 percent advance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed at a record. The greenback pared its biggest weekly gain since February as the Bank of England’s hawkish shift bolstered the pound. Oil ended near $50 a barrel to cap its best week since July. Yields on 10-year Treasuries topped 2.2 percent.#lazy-img-317761240:before{padding-top:56.25%;}With economic themes back in the foreground, markets are showing signs of becoming conditioned to provocative actions from North Korea, which has launched more than a dozen missiles this year and tested a nuclear device.

“Retail sales were weak but some of that is built in because you caught a piece of the hurricanes,” said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at Natalliance Securities. “Central banks trump everything else right now. They’re going to become much more important in the next wave of where markets move.”
